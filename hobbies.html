            <p class="mainText">I started out by going to gymnastics for about 10 years and near the end of the journey I got into contact with <span class="text_red">freerunning/parkour</span>. I instantly liked it and after a while made some videos. This is when I was 11/12, they are not the best ones, but I had never edited a video before, which is why I was making it while researching. The result(2011/2012):

            Still, after 4 years of not doing freerunning/parkour and not making videos, I still like it and would do it if I found somebody with the same interests. This is a 4 second video I made while I was on a trip to Latvia (2016).

            I also knew (for my age) a lot about computers (don't mean it in an arrogant way), but what I did not know was programming (2014/2015), which is why I decided to research it and concluded that I want to learn PHP with HTML/CSS to make websites. While learning it, I also started learning penetration testing and it was so much more fun as I knew what was happening behing the scenes and if I did not, I could easily research and learn it. While creating some projects here and there, I was to create a desktop application. I was not actually asked, but I saw my aunt doing the same thing over and over again, which is why I wanted to help her. I was limited to PHP, but I still made it. Fast-forward 2 weeks and I ported it to Python by reading the manual and rewriting it the application. This is when I really started liking programming - I just saw so much potential in it. I also found some minor vulnerabilities in other web applications/websites like xss, but I also found a very critical security vulnerability in a big and popular web application which I am still proud for. Right now, I am working closely with my aunt and another person to make a website for their businesses. <a href="http://andaart.com" target="_bank" class="blue">Andaart.com</a>, <a href="http://agrojums.lv" target="_bank" class="blue">Agrojums.lv</a>
